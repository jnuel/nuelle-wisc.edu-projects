--------------    Grep
 Output of dmesg --> input to grep
"Piping" | symbol between different commands

 Return Code 
0- successful
non-zero -- program was not successful

ls-l gives you the info and prints it out on the screen. 
Grep - finds the item in line and prints it out. 

**use "man" then the function to see what it does, how to use it and errors!!

Hexdump shows you both the binary representation and also the ascii representation on the right side.
-X in hexdump displays the input offset in hexidecimal

fgetline might be helpful! especially for GREP
How do you find if the line contains the string? Look at comparison function.

--------------   Wis-tar and Wis-untar
tar to compress files 
fprintf fputs for ascii
store a number as a binary representation? - use fwrite

here's the command i used for the file.
gcc -o wis-tarex wis-tarex.c -Wall -Werror
 % ./wis-tarex test-bin.tar
 % hexdump -C test-bin.tar
00000000  06 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                           |........|
00000008
// why is 06 in the leading spot? little endian
